# Python Practice: Coin Flip game
Just messing around with Python3 and trying to develop (see what I did there?) more real-life programming skills.

# The Game
So basically, you'll want to run this in the Python 3 shell.
When opened, it will ask you if you want to flip a coin, and you'll reply with 'y' or 'n'.
If you don't, it will bring back an error. Test it if you'd like.
It will continuously keep track of how many heads and how many tails you've gotten while flipping.
That's it really.

# Inspiration
I got the inspiration to create this from Idea Bag 2 on Android Play Store. Also, I just want to get better at programming.
